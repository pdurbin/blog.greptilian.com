The [schedule][] for [#HarvardDataFest][] is jam packed with awesome talks. I had to make a lot of tough choices today.

Unfortunately, I had to run out of [Data Visualization with Tableau][] with Jess Cohen-Tanugi to take a call but she did a fabulous job showing how to visualize [storms data][] (hurricanes, tropical storms, etc.), creating maps and "blending" data sources. I plopped myself down next to [Alyssa Goodman][] and I'm so glad I did. She had downloaded the storms data and was playing with it in [Glue][]. After the talk, she gave a 15 minute demo to me and Jess and I was amazed. I had seen Glue years ago (actually, I spun up the initial VMs when working at FAS Research Computing back in 2011 or so) and hadn't realized how much it had matured, how it's no longer a tool only for astrophysics. Glue is a visualization tool for all of science, and it's open source!

Next up was [Reproducible & Collaborative Data Science with the Renku Platform][] with [Rok Roskar][]. Having worked with Rok on getting data [out of][] and [into][] Dataverse I wasn't expecting to be surprised but the Renku [first steps][] docs he lead us through talk about Dataverse in step 2! I was so excited I couldn't resist [tweeting][] about it.

I stopped by [Interactive Data Visualization with Shiny in R][] with Ista Zahn and the [shiny_workshop][] materials he was leading us through looked fantastic but I don't have an immediate need for Shiny (and wasn't sure I wanted three hours of it) and wanted to see what else was cooking. I doubted Ista would be offended. He's a friend.

I caught the tail end of [Natural Language Processing with Python][] with Elizabeth Piette and it seemed really interesting. Afterwards I chatted with a research computing consultant from Harvard Medical School (HMS) and gave him a demo of launching RStudio in [Sid][] and he was suitably impressed. I also described the rsync-enabled installation of Dataverse that I expect will launch soon at HMS.

In [Scaling Geospatial Analyses on Harvard's High Performance Computing Cannon Cluster][] [Ben Lewis][] and [Devika Kakkar][] have a really interesting talk on using Singularity on top of FAS RC's new Cannon cluster to get some serious geospatial computation done.

Tomorrow I'm looking forward to welcoming [Fernando Pérez][] to Harvard.
