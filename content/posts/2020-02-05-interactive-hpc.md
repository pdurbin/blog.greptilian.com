Today I told a couple members of the [Sid][] team about a [talk][] at FOSDEM I attended on Sunday called "Interactive applications on HPC systems Jupyterhub, Galaxy, RStudio, XPRA."

I pointed out that the [slides][] show that they've looked at solutions like OnDemand but built their own thing.

I'm tempted to put this new project on my [list][] of things that look like Sid but I don't think it has a name and it isn't open source.
