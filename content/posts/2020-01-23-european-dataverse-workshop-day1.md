Ok, I'm not actually at [European Dataverse Workshop 2020][] but I'm enjoying the tweets from afar. I love how [#dataverse2020][] is [trending][] in Norway right now. I love how Oliver Bertuch describes Dataverse as a [vibrant community][]. [Shout outs][] are always appreciate, of course.

I think it's cool that the [list of participants][] is online. Without it, I wouldn't have been able to throw the data in Dataverse and Data Explorer to quickly get a histogram of the [19 countries][] are participating. Very impressive!
