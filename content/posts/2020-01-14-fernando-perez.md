[Fernando Pérez][] will be our keynote speaker at [DataFest 2020][] [next Wednesday][] and I'm looking forward to introducing him to various groups that are eager to meet with him.

I've been looking through his recent tweets and I like what I see:

- [Guix-Jupyter][]: Towards self-contained, reproducible notebooks
- How [GESIS][] joined the Binder federation
- The [lifecycle][] of open source scientific software

I love that he retweeted [Péter Király][] and [Carol Willing][], whom I consider friends, as well as [Dario Taraborelli][], whom I met at an open science [event][] a while back.

Of course I'll try to put on his radar recent integrations of Dataverse with Jupyter including [Binder][] and [Whole Tale][].
