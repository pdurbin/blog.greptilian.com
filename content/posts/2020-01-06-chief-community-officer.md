Late last week a package arrived at work. My office mate and I decided we should wait until more people were around before I opened it.

I knew [Oliver Bertuch][] had sent it because he told me it's not a bomb. I met Oliver in Berlin in February at an event called Open Science Days where I gave a [talk][] about Dataverse. He had been contributing to Dataverse for months and it was great to finally meet him. I put a [couple][] [pictures][] of the two of us hanging out on Twitter back then.

Today at standup I opened the box and to my surprise and delight I saw that Oliver had given me an award for the "Chief Community Officer." Here's the pic of the unboxing I put on [Twitter][]:

I am absolutely humbled by this act of generosity. Thank you, Oliver!
