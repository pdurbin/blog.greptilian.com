Today I popped into the Frictionless Data chat room to [ask][] a quick question about a potential integration.
This was a follow up on yesterday's [Dataverse Community Call][] when [Lilly Winfree][] joined (thank you!) to introduce herself and projects she's working on. I recently attended her talk called [Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research][] and as I said on the call, I highly recommend watching the video. Her [slides][] are great too.

It's funny, we have issues  going back five years about some of their technology.
