I'm excited about going to FOSDEM 2020 for many reasons.

I'll be giving a [talk on Dataverse][].

I've also been keeping any eye on a [thread][] on the Open Source Diversity forum about who to look for at FOSDEM.

Open source has a pretty terrible track record when it comes to diversity. A [2017 survey][] by GitHub indicates how male-dominated open source is by saying,

> "The gender imbalance in open source remains profound: 95% of respondents are men; just 3% are women and 1% are non-binary."

The FOSDEM [stands][] page doesn't yet list [Eco Hacker Farm] but someone from there kicked off the thread. There's also [CHAOSScon][] going on the day before.
