Today I watched a short [video][] about how Mozilla is moving from IRC to Matrix. The [slides][] are available as well.

[video]: https://youtu.be/YYGKHkLhKkk?t=169
[slides]: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L8qJITX3VIQ_hnCMZ-ec1ZgktGNQeW3vFfJ_LLvmMrs/edit

As far as I know, this is how the change unfolded:

- 2019-04-26 [IRC will go away](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/04/26/synchronous-text/)
- 2019-05-14 [explanation of process](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/05/14/the-next-part-of-the-process/)
- 2019-09-06 [four possibilities announced](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2019/09/06/forward-motion/)
- 2019-09-12 [feedback gathering](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-trial-servers-feedback/44871)
- 2019-12-19 [decision to go with Matrix announced](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/synchronous-messaging-at-mozilla-the-decision/50620)
- 2019-12-19 [welcome from Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/12/19/welcoming-mozilla-to-matrix)
- 2020-02-20 [we are live](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2020/02/20/synchronous-messaging-were-live/)

Now the [Matrix page][] in the Mozilla wiki explains how to connect and the fact that federation is enabled.

What's a little weird to me is that the [#general][] channel was publicly readable earlier, which is how I found that video and those slides, but now it's hidden behind a login. There are blog posts out there about Mozilla [Being Open By Design][] their new installation of Matrix feels pretty closed to me.
