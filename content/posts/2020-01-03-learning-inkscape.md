For years I've been meaning to learn Inkscape.

Recently, I found a nice [tutorial][] where [Jurgen Gaeremyn][] explains very clearly how to draw a kitten in a "vector" layer over top of a "bitmap" layer in Inkscape.

My daughter Erika and I were absolutely enthralled.

Here's the kitten we drew:

The really cool thing is that I emailed Jurgen to say thank you and he wrote back right away saying,

> "Your kitten turned our really nice! I'm glad you enjoyed the video. You added some really cool personal twists!"

Erika and I are still hacking away. I'm putting our creations under my [wiki page][] about Inkscape.
