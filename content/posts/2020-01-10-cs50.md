Today I went to the 411th consecutive [ABCD][] main meeting to hear [David Malan][] and [Kareem Zidane][] talk about [CS50][]'s use of Kubernetes. The talk was fantastic and the [slides][] are already [available][].

As luck would have it, I crossed paths with David on the way to the venue so we got a chance to chat a bit about [Open Source at Harvard][] and some other stuff.
