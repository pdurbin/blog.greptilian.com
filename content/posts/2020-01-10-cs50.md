Today I went to the 411th consecutive [ABCD][] main meeting to hear [David Malan][] and [Kareem Zidane][] talk about [CS50][]'s use of Kubernetes. The talk was fantastic and the [slides][] are already [available][]. It looks like a previous similar talk is on [YouTube][].

As luck would have it, I crossed paths with David on the way to the venue so we got a chance to chat a bit. I took [CS75][] in 2009 with him in person and really enjoyed it. It was taught in PHP and my [final project][] is still on GitHub. Fast forward to late 2019, about a month ago, and I reminded him who I am and explained an [Open Source at Harvard][] dataset I've been curating for a few years. Within a week he had created a [site][] based on that data. It sounds like Kareem played an important role so I was glad to meet him and plan to pick his brain about all this soon.

The most incredible stat from the talk is that over a million people have registered for CS50. It was also really interesting to hear how the technology to support the course has changed since 1987. The funny thing is that I still use the [ice/nice][] system from back then. Works great.
