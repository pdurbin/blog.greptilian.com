I watched a video on YouTube called [Large Language Models and the End of Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhCl-GeT4jw) by [Matt Welsh](https://github.com/mdwelsh), hosted by [CS50](/2020/01/10/cs50-and-kubernetes/). I considered attending the talk in person but didn't make time for it. I'm glad it was recorded. It's really good!

I first heard about Matt when he [blogged about leaving Harvard](http://matt-welsh.blogspot.com/2010/11/why-im-leaving-harvard.html) back in 2010. It was nice to hear he's doing well and right in the middle of the AI revolution that's suddenly surrounding us all. 

I love how he recited The Homework Machine by Shel Silverstein (a favorite with my kids) and talks about how [scary the author looks](https://youtu.be/JhCl-GeT4jw?si=uPn7yNY5Ga1AUImH&t=1016). Yeah, ["Shel Silverstein looks more like a burglar or a pirate than a guy who should be writing books for kids"](https://ifunny.co/picture/but-shel-silverstein-looks-more-like-burglar-ora-pirate-than-C86JoMXP8) according to The Diary of a Wimpy Kid.

Other tidbits:

- Stare at this code and tell me if it screams Conway's Game of Life.
- $220,000 for a developer in SF or Seattle vs. 12 cents a day for AI.
- [What Computers Can't Do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Dreyfus%27s_views_on_artificial_intelligence) (1972) sounds interesting.
- Let's think step by step.
- We need fewer electrical engineers than programmers, fewer people who understand how AI works.
