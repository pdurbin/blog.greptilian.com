The [first][] open source meetup in Brookline was a blast. Holmes and I were joined by eight other open source and decentralized web enthusiasts over drinks and dinner. We decided we'll do it again at the same place:

- When: Sunday, January 22nd, 2023 at 5pm ([Google Calendar][])
- Where: [Hamilton Restaurant & Bar][] (in the back room), 1366 Beacon Street Brookline, MA 02446 ([Google Maps][])

All are welcome, of course. If you'd like to RSVP (which certainly isn't required!), please just drop me a note at philipdurbin@gmail.com.

The group is using [Quiet][] to communicate (#boston in the Quiet-Team community). Please feel free to ask for the invite code.

By the way, due to scheduling conflicts, we're not sure if we're meeting in February. Please check back here for an update.
