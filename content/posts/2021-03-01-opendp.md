As of today I'm working 60% on [Dataverse][] and 40% on [OpenDP][].

My role for Dataverse will continue to be software development, but in OpenDP I'll focus on community management. My guess is that to some extent, I'll work in both code and communities for both projects.

I've been known to give a [talk][] or two about Dataverse, but I'm fairly new to OpenDP. The "DP" is short for [differential privacy][]. According to [opendp.org][],

> OpenDP is a community effort to build trustworthy, open-source software tools for statistical analysis of sensitive private data.

For a high-level overview, I hear the [OpenDP Whitepaper][] is well worth reading. I've also heard good things about [Differential privacy: A primer for a non-technical audience][].

I've also been thinking I should read through the introductions people have made on the [OpenDP mailing list][]. I also plan to poke around in the issues at [github.com/opendp][] and the chatter on [Gitter][].
