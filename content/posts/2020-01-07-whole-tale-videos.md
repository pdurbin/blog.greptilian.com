Today I was working away when [Craig Willis][] from [Whole Tale][] pinged me and asked me look over an email he plans to send about a new integration between Whole Tale and [Dataverse][].

In the email he plans to link to two videos, both of which do an incredible job of demonstrating the integration:

- [Starting from Dataverse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoSpQ3A7poY)
- [Starting from Whole Tale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWEcFpEUmrU)

[Craig Willis]: https://github.com/craig-willis
[Whole Tale]: https://wholetale.org
[Dataverse]: https://dataverse.org

Unless you're into science and reproducibility there's no need to watch the videos but they are so effective at getting the point across that I went ahead and linked to them in a [related issue][] I opened for another potential integration.

I also sent these videos around internally to two groups at work. I'm already sending them here and there to individuals. I'm sure I'll put them on [DataverseTV][] before long.

It's funny, when I was about a minute in to the first video I asked Craig if there's any sound. "Nope," he said, "That would have taken me twice as long." I was actually happy because I share an office and was able to take off my noise canceling headphones. Instead of talking he added captions throughout to explain what's going on. Really great work.

By the way, I was a fan of Craig for a while even before I got a chance to meet him at a conference in Chicago. My [talk][] was recorded, but there are no demos. 🙂

Update: Craig posted the [email][] to the list.
