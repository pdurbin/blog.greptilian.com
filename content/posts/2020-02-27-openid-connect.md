This morning I was just starting my day when [Oliver Bertuch][], frequent Dataverse contributor and [giver][] of gifts, pointed me to a test server making use of the OpenID Connect (OIDC) feature he [added][] to Dataverse 4.19. As chronicled in [today's IRC log][], I captured a lot of screenshots in a GitHub [issue][] and expressed a lot of enthusiasm over how this [next generation repository technology][] really works! Thanks, Oliver!
