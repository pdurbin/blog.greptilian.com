It's Valentine's Day which means it's Love Data Week. Lots of [cute][] [tweets][] in the air.

In addition, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) hosted a [workshop][] on "The Role of Generalist Repositories to Enhance Data Discoverability and Reuse," which I learned about in a [thread][] on the Dataverse mailing list.

The [video of day 1][] is available and I really enjoyed the first keynote by Sayeed Choudhury, especially around 31:40 where he talked about the triad of academia, government, and the private sector:

> "One thing I'll say, and I'd love to hear your opinions about this, we need the private sector. I know that there's a sort of mixed sort of relationship with our community and the private sector but the reality is that we need them. 
> 
> If you think about the development of the Internet and the web, it's a triad, quite frankly, of academia, government, and private sector. All three of them are really important for making the Internet and the web what they are today.
> 
> When it comes to publishers, I would argue that we didn't have that triad. The infrastructure that's been built has largely been built, in some sense, with the private view and not so much with the academic and government view. When it comes to the data landscape and the repositories we have an opportunity, and it really is that, to reestablish that triad: academia, government, and the private sector."
