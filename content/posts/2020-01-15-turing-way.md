The other day a contributor to [The Turing Way][] said they enjoyed the [videos](/2020/01/07/the-power-of-video-demos/) I made some noise about last week. She even [asked][] if she could add them to their newsletter.

"Of course!" I said, and today that newsletter was published.

You can read it on [tinyletter][] but here's the part I'm talking about:

> The Whole Tale open source platform for reproducible research
> 
> The Whole Tale project is an NSF-funded initiative building a scalable, open source platform for reproducible research. Whole Tale supports the creation, publication, and execution of tales -- executable research artifacts that capture, data, code and the complete software environment required to reproduce computational results. They along with Harvard Dataverse team have set up a platform to demonstrate tales using the Whole Tale platform as a dataset-level external tool on the demo instance at https://demo.dataverse.org.
> 
> Check out examples for two different use cases: 1) Whole Tale as Dataverse External Tool, demonstrating how Whole Tale can be used to launch an RStudio (or other) environment for exploration of "replication datasets" that contain code. 2) Registering data for analysis in Whole Tale, demonstrating how source datasets can be registered in Whole Tale for analysis using RStudio with automatic citation. A short document further describes the integration and planned features for anyone

The Turing Way folks are absolutely amazing. They let me introduce myself and Dataverse and recorded the whole thing on [YouTube][] back in October. I wrote a bit about it in a [thread][] on the Dataverse mailing list.
