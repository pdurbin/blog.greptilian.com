Today was the 15th and 20th work anniversary of two of my long time colleagues. Speeches were made. Cake was eaten. I heard about catacombs I didn't know existed under a nearby building. It was a great time.

I sat next to our resident logo designer (one of many hats he wears) and explained that I told my daughter Erika about him the other day when we were driving home from cello practice, that if she's having fun designing logos, that it's a real job.

See, her mother just started an LLC and her birthday is coming up so Erika has been working on a logo:

Tonight we unveiled the logo and got feedback. "Can we make the 'i' and the 'o' shorter?" we heard, so Erika make the adjustments you see above.

Oddly, the word "consulting" is not appearing for me in a brower but it's visible in Inkscape. I'll have to dig into this as some point.
