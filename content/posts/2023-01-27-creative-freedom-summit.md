Over the past few days, I binge listened to (and sometimes watched) all the [videos][] from the [Creative Freedom Summit][] that took place last week. I heard about it on the [Sustain Open Source][] podcast.

The [agenda][] was packed with interesting talks, but here are some of my favorites:

- [Automation in Inkscape by Máirín Duffy][]
- [Inkscape's Multipage Feature by Martin Owens][]
- [Creating Fedora Wallpapers with Krita by Madeline Peck][]
- Blender: Grease Pencil Speedpaint by Paul Caggegi
- Freelancing with Free Software by Ryan Gorley
- [A quick painting demo using Krita by David Revoy][]
- Brand & Badges: How Fedora Designers Create with Inkscape by Marie Nordin and Jess Chitas

(I'll update the links above as edited videos are available. I listened to the raw versions.)

I actually know some of these folks, such as Martin and Máirín (Mo) from real life and Ryan from [Inkscape Vectors][]. David Revoy is well known for his [Pepper&Carrot][] web comic. It's fun watching these artists show off their craft, when they aren't playing [Gartic Phone][].

It sounds like they want the discussion to continue in a [Matrix channel][] where I heard that they're looking for [help][] to get all the content up. (I've only put [a few minutes][] so far.)

I was glad to hear they plan to do it again next year.
