A while back, when I started using git, I thought it would be a good idea to keep my binary files outside of git.

I created a directory called "incfiles" on my server at the time. It was for files I want to include elsewhere. These days that directory lives at <http://thedurbins.com/static/incfiles>. I just found a pic of some cacti in there:

I was just pleasantly surprised that Hugo allows me to use non-local files as the featured image, like this:

Every once in a while technology just works. `\o/`

Maybe this means I'll put some more pics in this blog. Overall, I've been favoring SVG images since they're small and text-based.
