The talk I submitted to FOSDEM, "[Advancing science with Dataverse: Publication, discovery, citation, and exploration of research data][]," has been accepted! I also have a [speaker page][]. I'm waiting until I finish [coordinating][] a "fringe" event before I follow up on the [FOSDEM 2020 in Brussels Feb 1-2] to announce both (and tweet about it) but I'm very excited. This will be my first trip to Belgium and my first time attending FOSDEM.
