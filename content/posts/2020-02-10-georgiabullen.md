Today I listened to a talk by [Georgia Bullen][] called [Beyond the Pile of Knobs: Usability and Design for Privacy, Security, Safety & Consent Privacy][] given in the Open Source Design [devroom][] at FOSDEM. Her [slides][] are available but the [video][] is well worth listening to or watching.

Especially after hearing her say, 

> "Don't just focus on the majority cases, focus on the high-risk users and understand their threats."

I wonder what her take would be on the [Integrating DataTags with Harvard Dataverse][] poster. I understand that there is a lot of demand for the ability to share sensitive data but the risk seems great.

She mentioned working on a system called [PREreview][] ("a platform for the crowdsourcing of preprint reviews"), so she obviously has some experience in scholarly publishing.

As a geek, I also found it interesting that she has studied NoScript.
