In about a week I'm flying to Lisbon for [PIDapalooza][] 2020.

Looking through the [schedule][] and list of [speakers][] it should be a good conference. I added myself to the list of [attendees][].

As I mentioned in a [thread][] on the Dataverse mailing list, my talk about Dataverse wasn't accepted. Oh well, at the conference itself you can propose lightning talks so we'll see. At least I learned that the creator of OAI-PMH, [Herbert van de Sompel][], will [be there][]. Awesome.

I don't have a great history of sleeping on red eye flights so I can only say I'm hoping to check out a pre-conference [event][] hosted by Research Organization Registry ([ROR][]). Later that evening it looks like I'm supposed to keep an eye on [@pidapalooza][] to find people at [Time Out Market Lisbon][] for the [pre-festival kickoff celebration]

I'm glad to see Martin Fenner from DataCite, whom I met briefly at IQSS, is giving a talk about [versioning][]. Roberto Di Cosmo, whom I met at [Open Science Days 2019][], is giving a talk on Software Heritage Identifiers [SWH-IDs][]. Other speaker names I recognize are [Richard Wynne][] and [John Chodacki][].
