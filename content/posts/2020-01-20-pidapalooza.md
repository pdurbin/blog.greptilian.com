In about a week I'm flying to Lisbon for [PIDapalooza][] 2020.

Looking through the [schedule][] and list of [speakers][] it should be a good conference. I added myself to the list of [attendees][].

[schedule]: https://pidapalooza20.sched.com
[speakers]: https://pidapalooza20.sched.com/directory/speakers
[attendees]: https://pidapalooza20.sched.com/directory/attendees

As I mentioned in a [thread][] on the Dataverse mailing list, my talk about Dataverse wasn't accepted. Oh well. 🙂

It looks like I'm supposed to keep an eye on [@pidapalooza][] to find people at [Time Out Market Lisbon][].
