In [yesterday's post][] I mentioned that I was having trouble remembering the specifics of a talk from years ago.

[yesterday's post]: /2022/11/30/a-little-bit-of-anarchy-has-been-critical-to-the-success-of-the-internet/

Somewhat ironically, this was in the context of a conversation about chat apps where we touched on the usefulness (or not) of old chat logs. I was asked, "When do you find yourself going back to old chat logs?"

To find those specifics, I found myself going back to old chat logs!

Here was my process:

- When was the talk? November 2nd, 2016.
- Where would I have posted about this? The chat community I had set up.
- Check the chat logs near that date. [Bingo][].

Experiences like this only encourage me to double down on [SLOPI][], the idea that for open source there's value in having communication in the open and having it archived and searchable.

It's funny. I was partially inspired to start being more open and public in my communication (including chat) by a blog post entitled [Maximizing The Value of Your Keystrokes][], but the author of that post, Jeff Atwood, is very much [against][] keeping chat around for very long. For now, I plan to keep on maximizing those keystrokes.
