Today I made a quick sketch of my dog, Midnight.

He's a Shorkie, half Shih Tzu, half Yorkshire Terrier.

I was inspired by all the [Inkscape](/2020/01/03/learning-inkscape/) content during the 20th anniversary celebration today. I joined session one early this morning and then caught up on [videos][] by Martin Owens. In one, he [explained][] a new [template][] he created for making zines. Flip open my zine and you see my doggo.
