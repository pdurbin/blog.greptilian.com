In the opening keynote: \"[Towards the Circular Science][]: PIDs for a new generation of knowledge creation and management paradigm in Portugal: from vision to reality\" (Maria Fernanda Rollo, NOVA FSCH) 
[challenges and trends][], including new paradigm of data-driven science. [drawing][].  [reducing bureaucracy in science][]. student IDs allow aggregation of information.

[I shall be released or how to stop worrying about new versions][] Maria Helena Vieira Room Martin Fenner
Bob Dylan 1968
delima. federation or specificity/verifiability
credit vs verifiability

proposed solution:

- one PID per version and/or part, plus a global PID


[DOIs for Dataset versions][]

Show both. One for credit and one for verifiability (reproducibility).
Herbert. Memento for dates. DOIs per version may be overkill.

The EOSC PID Policy Sophia de Mello Room Sarah Jones.

Brian Matthews
 Sounds like "kiosk" without the "k".
PIDs as a pilar of FAIR research.

The [swh-id][]: a digital fingerprint identifying software source code Amália Rodrigues Room Morane Otilia Gruenpeter • Roberto Di Cosmo

[swh-id]: https://pidapalooza20.sched.com/event/Xl7G/the-swh-id-a-digital-fingerprint-identifying-software-source-code

swh prefix
1 is sha-1, may be bumped in the future for sha-256
cnt is the object type (content)

difference between sha-1 and sha-1 git?

[Fantastic PIDs and Where NOT to Find Them][] Alexandros Ioannidis

Carl Linnaeus invents the art of "naming things". 80% of species have not been described. Text mining with Plazi.

[Data curation and trust in a PID][] - how do we maintain the right balance? Maria Helena Vieira Room Brian Kirkegaard Lunn

Small and seemingly insignifican errors can generate user uncertainty.

[Closing keynote][]
Keynote: \"The Science Ecosystem and Open Science: a Multi-Legged Stool\" (Beth Plale, NSF) Sophia de Mello Room Beth Plale

[PAR][]
Mandate to do something about data.
Thinking beyond data as a homogenous product.
Data longevity. Sometimes 15 years is enough.
It's ok [not][] to keep all data forever.
Missing middle.
building something like Google Dataset Search, also uses Schema.org
PID Kernel, versions in the DOI.
Boring as hell or people don't understand it.
Include HPC like TACC.
Asking for DOI for datasets. Upper right. Non-DOI solutions for software, for now.
