My digital copy of [Life 3.0][] by Max Tegmark was just auto returned to the library again. I think I was somewhere in chapter 4.

I'm enjoying it, but when my friend Tony was over the other day I couldn't even articulate the three stages, so here's my attempt:

- Life 1.0, biological stage: life's hardware and software are fixed, except through evolution
- Life 2.0, cultural stage: life's hardware is fixed but software is not fixed because learning is common
- Life 3.0, technological stage: life designs its own hardware

These bullets seem to be fairly similar to a [post] on Science Friday. Also, I see the author and book appeared on the [MIT Artificial Intelligence Podcast][], which I'm a fan of, so maybe I'll give it a listen.

I heard about the book from a guy from Red Hat at DevConf last summer. He was really enthusiastic about it and gave a talk about AI, sort of Red Hat's AI strategy. Yes, I realize how buzz-wordy that sounds.
