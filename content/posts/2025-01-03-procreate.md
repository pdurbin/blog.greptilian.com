For Christmas, we bought a new iPad and our first [Apple Pencil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Pencil). I asked my brother, a professional [illustrator](https://www.instagram.com/brycedurbinart/), to recommend a drawing program and he suggested [Procreate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procreate_(software)). I'm so glad he did. I've been having a blast.

Playing around with Procreate is convincing me that you don't need a full desktop app to make great artwork. This is a bit of a paradigm shift for me. I'm still very interested in learning desktop apps like [Inkscape](/2020/01/03/learning-inkscape/) better (check out my drawing of [my dog](/2023/11/19/midnight/)), but it's a lot of fun to sketch and play and I love the portability of an iPad.

I can't recommend enough Procreate's the four-part [Beginner Series](https://procreate.com/beginners-series). Here are the mountains I drew as I watched the first video and got familiar with layers.

I need to go back and create the artwork in the rest of the series but I was so excited by the coverage of animation in part four that I started playing around with it. Here's my silly dog:

And an alligator:

(These two-frame animations remind me that my daughter and I created a "flip o'rama" inspired by Super Diaper Baby but I can't find it at the moment.)

I decided to recreate an animation from a Calvin and Hobbes [strip](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/06/18) from 1995. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. I texted my brother and said the onion skin feature reminded me of how we used to make animations on our Amiga computer using [Disney Animation Studio](https://archive.org/details/amiga-world-1990-09/page/n19/mode/2up) in the early 90s.

In addition to the tutorials, I'm finding myself dipping in and out of the [Procreate YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/procreate). I watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fdhPUoG9XY) about [Katsuya Terada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuya_Terada) and it struck my how he works from anywhere: outside, in a cafe, wherever. Somehow I made my way over to a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYK1OXlm7Us) about [Doug Chiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Chiang) who only talks about Procreate at the beginning but then goes on so show some really neat art he has made over the decades when working on Star Wars.
