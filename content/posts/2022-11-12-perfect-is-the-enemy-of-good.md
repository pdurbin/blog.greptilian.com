We bought an erg, mostly for our daughter, but it took me a few days to get on it because I wasn't sure if I'd set a new personal record. Here's the data:

```
date    	piece	time	split	stroke rate
2022-07-12	2000m	9:33	2:23	26
2022-07-31	2000m	9:14	2:19	27
2022-08-06	2000m	8:57	2:14	26
2022-08-22	2000m	8:42	2:11	26
```

I had managed to shave off a few seconds each time. Could I keep this up? I wasn't sure.

Yesterday I decided to just get on the erg and row a bit. Forget about the data. Forget about beating records. It's ok to just have some fun and get light workout. Then I changed into shorts and did a couple 2Ks before the day was through. I didn't add those observations to my dataset either.

Maybe it's the same with blogging. When I started this blog in 2020 I posted every day for two months. It was too much. I only posted twice last year. This is my first post of 2022. If it's the last, better one post than zero. Perfect is the enemy of good.

By the way, I drew the erg above. Usually I just look around for an image to use I'm inspired by how my other daughter [creates][] [digital][] [art][]. It's not perfect but, meh, good enough.
