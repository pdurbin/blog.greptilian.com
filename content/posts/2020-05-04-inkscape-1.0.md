Inkscape 1.0 was released today. The [release video][] is absolutely fantastic and captures the energy of the Inkscape community. The [announcement][] does a great job of describing new features with animations throughout.

I eventually got a dev environment set up on my Mac and it was exciting to see the latest code running but I'm really not a C++ developer and haven't found much time to contribute. I did make a few contributions to the new [Inkscape Beginner's Guide][] linked from the [books][] section of the website. The [source][] is Sphinx, which I'm familiar with from work.

Here's the [tweet][] if you'd like retweet or give a heart.

Thank you to all the Inkscape volunteers!
