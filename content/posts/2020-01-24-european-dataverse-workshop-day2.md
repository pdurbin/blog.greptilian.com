I'm still not in Tromsø, as I mentioned in my post about [day 1][], but it's fun to follow along with [European Dataverse Workshop 2020][] via [#dataverse2020][].

I was delighted to see [poikilotherm][] looking like such a [badass][]. I guess he was wearing all black when we [met][] in Berlin as well but this is a man who is serious about Dataverse and earns tweets like "[A look into the future of DevOps](https://twitter.com/stefankasberger/status/1220699387237629955)." You want this guy in your corner.

Thank you to [Stefan Kasberger][] for sharing slides ([pyDataverse - Easy data migrations into Dataverse](https://github.com/AUSSDA/pyDataverse_demo_tromso/blob/master/presentation.pdf)) and [workshop materials](https://github.com/AUSSDA/pyDataverse_demo_tromso) early. It's much appreciated!

What's next for Dataverse in Europe? Well, in three days I'm flying to Lisbon for [PIDapalooza][]. A week from today I'll be in Brussels for an [event][] hosted by The State Archives of Belgium and a couple days later I'll be giving a [talk][] about Dataverse at FOSDEM. (Yesterday I wrote the talk and practiced it a couple times.)

For 2021, Mercè Crosas says, "[There is a lot of interest in the Tromso workshop for a next European Dataverse in January 2021 in Portugal. Go for it!](https://twitter.com/mercecrosas/status/1220712014835671041)"

Is [hockey](https://twitter.com/shlakeuva/status/1220719874399322113) in our future? Stay tuned!!
