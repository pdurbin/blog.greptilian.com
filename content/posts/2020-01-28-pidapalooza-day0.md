I [mentioned][] my upcoming trip for PIDapalooza and now it's here! I flew out of Boston yesterday evening, couldn't sleep on the red eye, stood in an excruciatingly long line at customs in the Lisbon airport and had a variety of tribulations including nearly getting pick pocketed, but I made it!

After a power nap I took it as a sign that since I woke up in enough time to make it to the Research Organization Registry (ROR) that I should go, even though it was sold out and I'd be a few minutes late. It was gorgeous and sunny and I found everyone in a packed basement conference room. I haven't found a good crown shot on Twitter but I'd say there were a good 40 people at least. Here's a pic of the [organizers][]. This community is absolutely passionate about PIDs, as if the [fingernail polish][] weren't a clue. I crowded into one of the few open seats left.
