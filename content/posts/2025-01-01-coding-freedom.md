At the recent [OFA conference](/2024/11/14/ofa-symposium/) I met someone who has brought her copy of Coding Freedom to Harvard to get it signed by the author, [Gabriella Coleman](https://gabriellacoleman.org), who is a [professor](https://anthropology.fas.harvard.edu/people/gabriella-coleman) in the department of Anthropology.
