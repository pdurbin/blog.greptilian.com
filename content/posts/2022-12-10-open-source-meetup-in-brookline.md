Who's coming? Well, the two co-organizers for sure. If you'd like to be added to the list below, please email me at philipdurbin@gmail.com.

This will be a very casual event. If it's just me and Holmes, we might just sit at the bar. If this time and location works well, we might make this a monthly event. All are welcome! See also the posts on [Mastodon][] and [Twitter][] by Holmes.
