I'm co-organizing an open source meetup in Brookline about a week from now:

- When: Sunday, December 18th, 2022 at 5pm
- Where: [Hamilton Restaurant & Bar][], 1366 Beacon Street Brookline, MA 02446 ([Google Maps][])

[Hamilton Restaurant & Bar]: https://hamiltonbrookline.com
[Google Maps]: https://goo.gl/maps/Xn9q3wVHF5Q4jJsZA

Who's coming? Well, the two co-organizers for sure. If you'd like to be added to the list below, please email me at philipdurbin@gmail.com.

- Philip Durbin (co-organizer), developer for [Dataverse][]
- Holmes Wilson (co-organizer), creator of [Quiet][]
- ...

[Dataverse]: https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse
[Quiet]: https://github.com/TryQuiet/quiet

This will be a very casual event. If it's just me and Holmes, we might just sit at the bar. If this time and location works well, we might make this a monthly event. All are welcome!
