Tonight I went to a fantastic [talk][] by [Amy X. Zhang][] called "Systems to Improve Online Discussion."

[talk]: https://www.bostonchi.org/2020/01/amy-zhang/
[Amy X. Zhang]: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/

I met Amy last year at LibrePlanet and shortly afterward made a [note][] to myself to follow up with her about communication platforms.

Digging through old emails, it looks like I first reached out to her in June 2015. I head heard good things about Hackstack at the [first][] Dataverse Community Meeting and read her [paper][] called "Mailing Lists: Why Are They Still Here, What's Wrong With Them, and How Can We Fix Them?" She built a system called [Murmur][] to address these problems and I signed up for an account right away. If you check the [About][] page for Good Labs, you can see it's the mailing list software we use.

In her talk she mentioned several new projects I wasn't familiar with:

- [Wikum][]
- [Tilda][]
- [YoUPS][]
- [Squadbox][]
- [Digital Juries][]
- [PolicyKit][]

[Tilda]: https://tildachat.com

[Squadbox]: https://squadbox.org
[Digital Juries]: http://digitaljuries.com
[PolicyKit]: https://github.com/amyxzhang/policykit

She's so full of ideas, it's hard to keep up with her!
