Tonight I went to a fantastic [talk][] by [Amy X. Zhang][] called "Systems to Improve Online Discussion."

[talk]: https://www.bostonchi.org/2020/01/amy-zhang/
[Amy X. Zhang]: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~axz/

I met Amy last year at LibrePlanet and shortly afterward made a [note][] to myself to follow up with her about communication platforms.

Digging through old emails, it looks like I first reached out to her in June 2015. I head heard good things about Hackstack at the [first][] Dataverse Community Meeting and read her [paper][] called "Mailing Lists: Why Are They Still Here, What's Wrong With Them, and How Can We Fix Them?" She built a system called [Murmur][] to address these problems and I signed up for an account right away. If you check the [About][] page for Good Labs, you can see it's the mailing list software we use.

In her talk she mentioned several new projects I wasn't familiar with:

- [Wikum][]: recursive summarization
- [Tilda][]
- [YoUPS][]
- [Squadbox][]
- [Credibility Coalition][]
- [Digital Juries][]
- [PolicyKit][]: a toolkit for self-governance

[Wikum]: http://wikum.org
[Tilda]: https://tildachat.com
[YoUPS]: https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/better-email-automation
[Squadbox]: https://squadbox.org
[Digital Juries]: http://digitaljuries.com
[PolicyKit]: https://github.com/amyxzhang/policykit
[Credibility Coalition]: https://credibilitycoalition.org

I rather not keep the piece of paper I scribbled on, so here are my notes:

- online discussion is getting worse
- two problems
  - scale
  - competing norms
- "a civilization of the mind" [quote][] by John Perry Barlow
- power to speak but power to curate is missing
- need tools for collective curation
- need to summarize unwieldy discussion
- a wiki is neutral and easy to read compared to a forum
- "answer wiki" on Quora is not connected to any posts
- people don't want to edit each other's writing (they append in Google Docs)
- lot of discussion in Jane Austen "talk" page on Wikipedia
- summarization as listening
- Wikum+ for living documents
- when returning from vacation to Slack, people scroll up until they become tired
- people want two things from summaries:
  - structure
  - context
- people are harrassed in different ways
- between user moderation and platform moderation could be networked moderation
- [Block Party][]
