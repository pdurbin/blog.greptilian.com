Today I had an absolutely fabulous call with [Ed Thomson][] and [Rimas Silkaitis][] from GitHub.

As I mentioned in my [post][] about my talk at FOSDEM a couple weeks ago, Ed attended my talk and approached me afterwards saying he's like to hear more the take Dataverse has on scientific reproducibility.

Here are the [notes][] from our meeting. It was so much fun talking to these guys. It makes me want to go back and listen to all the episodes of [All Things Git][], which I believe is where I first encountered Ed. That podcast is what prompted me to @mention him in a Dataverse [issue][]. Also, I don't think I mentioned this to Ed, but it's extremely cool that he's a maintainer of [libgit2][].
