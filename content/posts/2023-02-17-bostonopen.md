The [first][] [two][] open source meetups in Brookline were a ton of fun. We had ten and then eleven people. Due to travel we're skipping February, but we're on for March:

- When: Sunday, March 26, 2023 at 5pm ([Google Calendar][])
- Where: [Hamilton Restaurant & Bar][] (in the back room), 1366 Beacon Street Brookline, MA 02446 ([Google Maps][])

[first]: /2022/12/10/open-source-meetup-in-brookline
[two]: /2023/01/03/open-source-meetup-in-brookline-2

Come one, come all. If you'd like to RSVP (which certainly isn't required!) or ask for the invite code to #boston in [Quiet][], please email <philipdurbin@gmail.com>.

In other news, I registered a domain ([bostonopen.dev][]) and set up a GitHub org ([bostonopen][]) for the group, but these should be considered a bit preliminary. In fact, I started a discussion area where we can talk about things like [what our name should be][] and if we should pick a more predicable day to meet like the [third Sunday of the month][]. Please feel free to join these discussions or kick off another.

[bostonopen.dev]: https://bostonopen.dev
[bostonopen]: https://github.com/bostonopen
[what our name should be]: https://github.com/orgs/bostonopen/discussions/1
[third Sunday of the month]: https://github.com/orgs/bostonopen/discussions/2

We also have a couple logos to use, again preliminary:

![](/images/bostonopendev-logo.svg)

(My daughter created the open box drawing and I threw together the other.)

I'll probably transition to posting upcoming meetups on [bostonopen.dev][] instead of this blog. Hope you can make it!
