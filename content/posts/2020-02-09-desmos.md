My daughter was introduced to [Desmos][] in her 8th grade math class and she's having a blast creating art with it.

The [Wikipedia article][] for Desmos describes it as an **advanced graphing calculator** and mentions toward the end that "another peculiar use of the calculator involves the creation of graphic arts."

Sure enough, the [Staff Picks: Creative Art][] link on the Desmos home page reveals pictures of [bears][], a [shark][], a [chick][], a [seal][], and more. I find the bears especially cute.

But how do you get started? I clicked "Start Graphing" and asked my daughter what to type. She started me off with two equations:

```
y = 2x + 8
x^2 + y^2 = 8
```
Suddently, I had created my [first][] graph with Desmos, which looks like this:

Not nearly as sophisticated as the [penguin][] my daughter made, but it's a start. 🙂

I was delighted to see that you can export your graphs (your artwork!!) in SVG format. That means you can further manipulate it in tools like [Inkscape][].
